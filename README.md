# MyApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

# Installation

Step 1. Verify that you are running at least node 6.9.x and npm 3.x.x by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors, but newer versions are fine.

Then install the Angular CLI globally.

content_copy
`npm install -g @angular/cli`
 Step 2. Create a new project
Open a terminal window.

Generate a new project and skeleton application by running the following commands:
`ng new my-app`
Patience, please. It takes time to set up a new project; most of it is spent installing npm packages.

Step 3: Serve the application
Go to the project directory and launch the server.

`cd my-app`
`ng serve --open`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Using the `--open (or just -o)` option will automatically open your browser on http://localhost:4200/

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
